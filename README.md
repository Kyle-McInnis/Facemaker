# Facemaker



Created in Visual Studio in C#, this app allows the user to create a custom face from selecting between different presets of hair, eyes, nose, and mouth options. There is also a database component to this application as well. Users can enter their name, city, hobbies, and occupation and have it stored in a database created with SQL.

This app was created for an assignment for my C# class at COGS NSCC campus.
